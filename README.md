This is a personal website I built to display my projects and contact information. The site is built with HTML and CSS and without premade templates.  Features include both grid and flexbox layouts, SVG sprite icons, custom polygons, and cubic bezier animations. The site is very responsive, with media queries for six screen widths: 1200px, 900px, 700px, 550px, 450px, ansd 350px.
