This is a personal website I built to display my projects and contact information. The site is built with HTML and CSS, without premade templates.  Features include both grid and flexbox layouts, SVG sprite icons, custom polygons, and cubic bezier animations. Media queries from 900px, 700px, 550px, 450px, ansd 350px create a responsive user experience.
