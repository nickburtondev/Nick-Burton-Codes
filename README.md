This is a personal website I built to display my work and contact information. The site is built with HTML and CSS and without premade templates.  Features include both grid and flexbox layouts, SVG sprite icons, custom polygons, and cubic bezier animations. The site is highly responsive, with media queries for six different screen widths: 1200px, 900px, 700px, 550px, 450px, ansd 350px, and includes links to other projects as well as my contact information.
