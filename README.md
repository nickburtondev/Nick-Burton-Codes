This is a personal responsive website I built using HTML and CSS.  Features include both grid and flexbox components, SVG icons and sprite, customs polygons, and cubic bezier animations. The site responds to six different screen widths: 1200px, 900px, 700px, 550px, 450px, ansd 350px, and includes links to other projects as well as my contact information.
